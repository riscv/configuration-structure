== External Debugger

Unified Discovery allows an external debugger to determine the configuration, features and 
capabilities of the hardware platform. This information does not indicate any runtime 
configuration of the hardware such as enable / disable of feature and mode switch.
For example, the current MMU mode cannot be discovered via Unified Discovery.
