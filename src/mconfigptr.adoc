== The mconfigptr CSR

The machine config pointer (mconfigptr) CSR provides the base-address of the 
binary-encoded representation. The mconfigptr is a machine-mode CSR. On platforms that 
do not require runtime update of the address of the binary representation of the 
configuration, this register can be hardwired to zero.

For backward compatibility, the firmware can emulate this CSR on platforms that do not 
implement this CSR prior to this proposal.
