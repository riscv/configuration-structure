== The mconfigptr CSR

The machine config pointer (mconfigptr) CSR provides the base address of the 
binary encoded representation (BER) of the ASN.1 structures. mconfigptr is a
machine-mode CSR. On platforms not requiring runtime updates to the configuration
base address, this register can be hardwired to zero.

For backward compatibility, M-mode firmware can emulate this CSR on platforms that predate
or do not implement this proposal.
