== ASN.1 Schema

The Unified Discovery ASN.1 Schema can be broken down in to the following pieces for 
better understanding.

The header that declare the data structure:

....
RISCV-Unified-Discovery DEFINITIONS AUTOMATIC TAGS ::=
BEGIN
....

The header is followed by the import segment for the `SignedData` type from Cryptographic 
Message Syntax. This is used to provide the envelope for message authentication.
....
IMPORTS
  SignedData
  FROM CryptographicMessageSyntax-2010
    { iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549)
          pkcs(1) pkcs-9(9) smime(16) modules(0) id-mod-cms-2009(58) };
....

The envelope type follows the import segment. Signing of the message is optional.

....
  UnifiedDiscoveryEnvelop ::= SignedData
....

The content type in the `SignedData` is encoded as an object identifier. Two such 
identifiers are specified. Each corresponds to an encoding scheme.

....
  id-UnifiedDiscovery-UPERencoded OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
  ...
  id-UnifiedDiscovery-DERencoded OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
....

In the value notations, vendors can specify the JEDEC manufacturers identifier to identify 
themselves.  The `JEDEC-ID` type provides the short-hand type.

The `DiscoveryAdditionalData` is the Container format type referred to in 
<<_container_format>>. It provides the means for inclusion of vendor-specific data.

The next part contains types that are created for RISC-V extensions that include 
configurable hardware parameters. The `RVVConfig` is for the V extension. The V extension 
allows implementations to choose VLEN among a set of legal values. The legal values are 
provided as named members of this type, such as `vlen128`.

The `DiscoveryErrata` type allows vendors to expose errata information. An OID is used to 
identify the errata. The `url` field is provided to provide access to the human readable 
form of the errata information.

The bulk of the definition is in `DiscoveryData` type. This is a Sequence that contains 
all ratified RISC-V extensions up to a release date. For extensions that do not provide 
configurable hardware parameters, they appear as an empty Sequence named after the 
official RISC-V abbreviation. For extensions that do provide such parameters, they appear 
as members of the specific type declared above, also named after the official RISC-V 
abbreviation.

The `version` member allows vendors to specify a version for its discovery data.

The `ext` member is of the Container format type defined above.

The `DiscoveryData` is extensible, which is indicated by the `...` lines after `version` 
and before `errata`. It is up to the vendor to include further members for their convenience.

=== The Discovery Data

The vendors declare instances of the `DiscoveryData` to describe the hardware 
configurations. For example:

....
exampleDiscoveryData DiscoveryData ::= {
    version 1,
    c {},
    d {},
    f {},
    sv39 {},
    sv48 {},
    sv57 {},
    svpbmt {},
    rvv {
        vlen vlen1024
    },
    zicsr {},
    zihpm {}
}
....

This instance describes an imaginative hart that implements the `c`, `d`, `f`, `sv39`, 
`sv48`, `sv57`, `svpbmt`, `rvv`, `zicsr` and `zihpm` extentions. This instance is encoded 
as binary and distributed along with hardware.

=== Container Format

The `DiscoveryAdditionalData` allows vendors to include arbitrary binary data. This type 
contains a `contentType` member that serves as the unique identifier of the vendor who 
supplies this arbitrary data. The `payload` member actually stores the data.

The type is reproduced below:

....
  DiscoveryAdditonalData ::= SEQUENCE
  {
    contentType CHOICE {
        oid     [0] OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
        url     [1] UTF8String,
	    numeric [2] SEQUENCE {
          manufacturer   JEDEC-ID,
          identifier     INTEGER
	    }
    },
    payload	OCTET STRING
  }
}
....

The `contentType` member can be one of `OBJECT IDENTIFIER` as defined in the ASN.1 
standard, a `UTF8String` which contains the URL to the vendor, or a pair (JEDEC-ID, 
INTEGER). 

The `payload` is a `OCTET STRING`. Its decoding is decided by the vendor who includes this 
payload. Do note that the vendor needs to provide corresponding means to decode the 
`payload` in its deployment environment, e.g. providing the routine to decode the binary 
in the firmware.

=== Standard Elements

The standard elements can be of two general types. Extensions that do not provide 
configurable hardware parameters such as `sv39`:

....
sv39     SEQUENCE { } OPTIONAL
....

are simply optional empty Sequences. By including an instance in the discovery data, the 
vendor indicates the existence of the extension.

Other extensions such as the V extension provides configurable parameters. The `RVVConfig` 
type captures the parameters. Its current definition is reproduced below:

....
RVVConfig ::= SEQUENCE {
    vlen    BIT STRING {
                vlen128(0),
                vlen256(1),
                vlen512(2),
                vlen1024(3) }
}
....

Unified Discovery expects all such extensions provide their specific configuration 
parameter types.
