== Hypervisor: Unified Discovery for Guest OSes

Hypervisors typically construct higher-level discovery structures, such as ACPI Tables or 
device tree, directly from desciption of the virtual machines. The description may or may 
not be related to the physical hardware platform on which the hypervisor is running.  
Therefore, Unified Discovery is not a necessary component in virtualization.

[NOTE]
====
If in any case, a virtual machine attempts to read the mconfigptr CSR, this read can be 
trapped and emulated.
