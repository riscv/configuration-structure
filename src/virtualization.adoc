== Hypervisor: Unified Discovery for Guest OSes

For virtualization purposes, only the retrieval of the mconfigptr CSR has to be 
intercepted (i.e. either a virtualized CSR would be provided to the guest that can be 
written by the hypervisor â€” or trap-and-emulate would be used) if the guest is to be 
provided with a configuration structure that may or may not be from what is retrieved from 
the underlying hardware.
